Encryption Decryption of Text messages using Caesar cipher algorithm

This Project demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt text messages using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. It is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques, based on shifting characters by a fixed number of positions.

This Project allows the user to:
Enter a text message
Enter a secret key(shift value)
Encrypt the message
Decrypt it back to the original

Features of the Project
  Encrypts any text message
  Decrypts using the same key
  Handles uppercase and lowercase letters
  Leaves symbols, numbers, and spaces unchanged
  Simple, fast, begginer-friendly algorithm.
